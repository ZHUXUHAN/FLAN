The code of 'Local Context Attention Learning for Fine-Grained Scene Graph Generation'.

Install commond: torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2. python setup.py build develop. 
More details on datasets and installations can be found in [Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch).

You can evaluate the trained model with the commond: sh scripts/test.sh.
The webpath of the pre-trained model is: 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lOnfl0iHAxYHeW9PJIzTyfqnl8RxNfLg?usp=drive_link'
